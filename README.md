# AI-Driven Industry–Academia Curriculum Alignment System

## 📌 Problem Statement
Technologies used by industries evolve rapidly, while university curriculum are updated infrequently. This results in a significant skill gap where graduates are not fully prepared for industry expectations, especially during internships and placements.

This project aims to bridge the gap between **industry-required skills** and **university-taught curriculum** using **AI, NLP, and trend analysis**, enabling data-driven curriculum updates.

2. Identify skill gaps and syllabus misalignment (e.g., skills taught too late).
3. Quantify the impact of curriculum gaps on placements and companies.
4. Track emerging industry trends using company career pages.
5. Recommend priority topics based on trends.
6. Generate overview and full syllabi for new or updated courses.
7. Demonstrate benefits of syllabus updates in terms of placement readiness.
